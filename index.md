### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was my favorite, since I always wondered how blackjack was played. I liked this lab because of how many if statements were being used in it, so it took some code management to make it look readable. It was also one of the few labs that I struggled with most, which I enjoyed since I like challenges like these. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites since I enjoy learning little facts and learning what words are palindromes was interesting. In this lab we used .rbegin() and .rend() which was used to reverse the word to see if it was a palindrome, which I thought was cool to do. This lab was on the easier side but still enjoyable to do since it was interesting to do.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was enjoyable to do since it was making my first animation. This lab has two files in it, one was the normal .cc file that we have used throughout the year and the other was a .cc that held the functions for the program, which made managing the code easy and made it more readable for people. I enjoyed this lab since I always wondered how they were made, and I plan on messing around with the program during winter break
